# Traffic Sign Recognition

Link to the original project by ndrplz who used TensorFlow to train the model : https://github.com/ndrplz/self-driving-car/tree/master/project_2_traffic_sign_classifier

This is a PyTorch version of the above project to build a **CNN** in **PyTorch** to **classify traffic sign images** from the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).

Main steps covered here are:
- dataset exploration and visualization
- data augmentation
- deep network design and training
- test accuracy of the trained model
